how can I permanently change the model?

** Ellama:
As an intelligent assistant built on a specific model, my function and
performance are determined by this model. To "permanently" change the
model used in me, you would need to understand what constitutes
"permanently." 

If you mean making changes at the software level or through updates,
it's possible that there might be future updates from DeepSeek that
introduce new models or improve the current one, which could alter my
responses. However, this is not something you can do manually as a
user. It's important to note that changing models would typically
require access to the underlying code and permissions that are usually
reserved for developers and administrators who manage AI systems like
mine.

If you meant "permanently" in terms of a different version or
iteration of me, there could be scenarios where updates or changes to
my system might lead to new features or alterations in how I respond,
but these would again require developer intervention and wouldn't be
something users can control directly.

For any specific information about model updates or changes, it's best
to check the latest releases or documentation from DeepSeek for
accurate details on what modifications are made and when they might
take effect.
